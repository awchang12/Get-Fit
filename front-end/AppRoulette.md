QA - App Roulette

1. Stress Testing- make lots of requests, press all the buttons
2. Security Checkout- if there is user auth ensure that you cannot access pages intended only for those users 
3. User friendliness- can users understand your app
4. Completeness of documentation- does the person have a README? Is it complete?
5. Multiple User Interface deployment- if the app is designed to be responsive, bring it up in different screen sizes, devices, and browsers.

* When I click on the "Foods" tab after creating a new user, there are two headings: "Foods" and "Food," and nothing else.

<!-- * Maybe when you edit your profile it should prepopulate your old info? -->
<!-- * Should a user be able to change their username? Right now, that looks like an option, although nothing happens when I try. Actually, the field turns yellow as if there's an error, but that's all. -->
<!-- * Should they be able to change their starting weight from the edit profile page?
* Nothing seems to happen when I try to submit the edit profile form. -->
<!-- * You can log future dates. -->
<!-- * Dates don't log in order. The date logged most recently seems to be added to the end, even if there are other dates already beyond that on the graph. Unless, that is, the date is already on the graph. Then it draws the line backwards. -->
<!-- * If you are already a user and enter your username and pw on the New User Form, it logs you in. Kinda weird. Actually, it prepopulated the fields with my username and password. -->
